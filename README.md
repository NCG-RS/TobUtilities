# Tob Utilities

The primary goal of this plugin is to minimize the need for mid-raid configuration changes as well as add some new functionalities

## Features:

### Maiden
- Chat message on entry regarding the chance of a scuff based on maidens index
- Highlighting of scuffed spawns

### Bloat
- The ability to hide self or other players while in bloat room

### Nylocas
- Aggressive highlighting

### Verzik
- The ability to hide verzik with a hotkey 
- An overlay to indicate which player is holding dawnbringer. 
This works with party plugin as well to track if a teammate has it in their inventory

### Metronome
- A visual metronome which changes tick count based on room. This does not sync to the instance timer/timing of game mechanics but can be used to avoid mid raid configuration changes for visual metronome users

Special thanks to Vincent0955 who created the original visual metronome
